Last 4 years developer survey result analysis


## Libraries Used
Except from python3 built-in functions, below libraries were used:

- pandas==0.24.2
- numpy==1.16.4
- plotly==4.3.0
- matplotlib==3.1.0

## Motivation

Software technologies are one of the most popular sectors around the world these days. There is no doubt that programming languages form the basis of this industry. While there are a lot of choices among the existing programming languages, which one should be preferred is an inevitable question. Therefore I decided to investigate following questions:

- What are the usage trends of programming languages over the last four years?
- Is the programming language want to be worked with influenced from the profession?
- Is computer science background affect the working language?

## Summary of the results

-We analyze the evaluation of the programming language used in the last four years. The results yield that leadership of Javascript, SQL and Python are following it. We also noticed the prevalence of Typescript in this review.
-We investigate the preference for programming language based on profession types. We see that each kind of developers wants to work with different programming languages.
-We want to explore the biases between computer science background and work languages. We came to the conclusion that says developers with a computer science degree are more prone to use low-level languages.
